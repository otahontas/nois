# Alembic migrations

This is generic single-database configuration. After changing Gino models, db migrations can be ran as follows:
1. Generate revisions with `poetry run alembic revision --autogenerate -m 'Message describing the changes'`
2. Check the generated revision files, fix things if not ok
3. Run changes with `poetry run alembic upgrade head`
4. Commit
